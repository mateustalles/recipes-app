Project made by friends @ Trybe dev school a while ago

The purpose here was to create a simple recipes app for food and beverage, where the client would be able to fill up recipes, check suggestions, searches for recipes based on ingredients, region, and so on...

The project features automated UI testing using Jest with React-Testing-Library and was very fun to do

Made using Trello and pair programming
